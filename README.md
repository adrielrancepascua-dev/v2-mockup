## Executive Summary

**NursePath** is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) developed as an **academic learning tool** for nursing students. The application serves as a digital study companion that reinforces textbook concepts taught in the classroom.

This project addresses two educational objectives:

1. **Concept Reinforcement** — Provides interactive examples of drug dosage calculations and IV flow rate formulas that mirror textbook exercises, helping students practice and internalize mathematical nursing concepts.

2. **Reference Accessibility** — Offers a searchable compilation of commonly discussed OTC medications and vital signs ranges, serving as a portable study reference similar to pocket nursing guides.

The application operates entirely offline after initial installation, making it convenient for studying in various environments including libraries, dormitories, or areas with limited connectivity.

**Important:** This is a learning reinforcement tool, not a clinical resource. All content reflects standard nursing textbook material and is intended to support classroom instruction, not replace it.

## Features

### 🧭 Navigation
- Simple navigation bar for easy access to different sections
- Smooth scrolling between study modules
- Color-coded sections for quick identification

### 👻 Ghost Persistence (Demo Auth)
- Email is treated as pilot identity (username/session ID), not strict inbox-auth login
- No password and no signup screen
- Enter email once and the device is locally sealed for auto-bypass on next launches
- Built-in cooldown and typo-domain checks (e.g. gmal.com) to reduce bounce backs
- Best-effort email logging (local always, Supabase when online)
- Access modes: `Demo` (open testing), `Pilot` (allowlisted domain or invite code), `Admin` (faculty token)
- Visible `Logout` and `Faculty Reset` controls are available in-app

### 📈 Offline Usage Analytics Queue
- Meaningful events only: session_start, session_end, feature_open, feature_use, result_generated, copy_reference, help_opened, error_shown
- Local queue first (`nursepath_usage_queue_v1`) so events survive dead zones/offline shifts
- Batch sync to Supabase when internet returns
- Session boundaries with session IDs and duration tracking
- Consent-controlled tracking toggle on the auth overlay
- Telemetry for vitals/IV/BMI/AOG is button-driven (`Simulate`/`Calculate`) instead of keystroke-driven, so results and logs occur only on explicit user action
- Anonymous by default for usage events unless explicitly enabled via runtime config
- Built-in pilot metrics snapshot panel and CSV export for faculty review

### 💉 IV Flow Rate Practice Calculator
- Demonstrates **mL/hr** calculations for infusion scenarios
- Shows **gtt/min** (drops per minute) formula applications
- Supports standard drop factors: 10, 15, 20, and 60 gtt/mL

## Access Information

### Login Method

Users start by selecting an access mode and entering an email.

1. Enter your school email or a valid invite code.
2. Tap Enter Pilot Workspace.
3. The app stores `nursepath_user` on the device and opens immediately.
4. On next launches, `nursepath_user` auto-bypasses the access overlay for offline continuity.

Internet is optional for pilot entry. If online, the app also attempts to log the email to Supabase.

### Supabase Configuration Required (Demo)

For Ghost Persistence pilot mode, Supabase is used for logging only.

1. Keep project URL and anon key configured in the app.
2. Run the SQL setup below to create logging tables + insert policies.
3. Confirm RLS is enabled and insert policy exists for `anon` and `authenticated`.

No SQL schema change is required for button-driven telemetry. Existing `usage_events` columns and indexes remain valid.

### Supabase SQL Setup (Run In Order)

Run this full script in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1) Email auth log table (best-effort login identity log)
create table if not exists public.auth_email_log (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  email text not null,
  status text not null,
  reason text,
  timestamp timestamptz not null default now()
);

alter table public.auth_email_log enable row level security;

drop policy if exists "allow anon insert auth_email_log" on public.auth_email_log;
create policy "allow anon insert auth_email_log"
on public.auth_email_log
for insert
to anon, authenticated
with check (true);

-- 2) Usage events table (offline queue flush target)
create table if not exists public.usage_events (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  event_id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_email text,
  session_id uuid,
  feature text not null,
  action text not null,
  meta jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb,
  timestamp timestamptz not null default now(),
  online boolean,
  duration_ms integer
);

alter table public.usage_events enable row level security;

drop policy if exists "allow anon usage insert" on public.usage_events;
create policy "allow anon usage insert"
on public.usage_events
for insert
to anon, authenticated
with check (true);

drop policy if exists "allow anon usage select" on public.usage_events;
create policy "allow anon usage select"
on public.usage_events
for select
to anon, authenticated
using (true);

-- 3) Helpful indexes for pilot reporting
create index if not exists usage_events_timestamp_idx on public.usage_events (timestamp desc);
create index if not exists usage_events_feature_action_idx on public.usage_events (feature, action);
create index if not exists usage_events_user_email_idx on public.usage_events (user_email);
create index if not exists usage_events_session_id_idx on public.usage_events (session_id);

create index if not exists auth_email_log_timestamp_idx on public.auth_email_log (timestamp desc);
create index if not exists auth_email_log_email_idx on public.auth_email_log (email);
```

### Supabase Verification Queries

After running setup, run these checks:

```sql
-- tables exist
select table_name
from information_schema.tables
where table_schema = 'public'
  and table_name in ('auth_email_log', 'usage_events');

-- RLS enabled
select tablename, rowsecurity
from pg_tables
where schemaname = 'public'
  and tablename in ('auth_email_log', 'usage_events');

-- policies exist
select schemaname, tablename, policyname, roles, cmd
from pg_policies
where schemaname = 'public'
  and tablename in ('auth_email_log', 'usage_events');
```

### Pilot Reporting Queries (Starter)

```sql
-- Top features used
select feature, action, count(*) as events
from public.usage_events
group by feature, action
order by events desc;

-- Average session duration (ms)
select avg(duration_ms)::bigint as avg_session_ms
from public.usage_events
where feature = 'session'
  and action = 'session_end'
  and duration_ms is not null;

-- Distinct users seen
select count(distinct user_email) as users
from public.usage_events
where user_email is not null;
```

### Bounce-Back Mitigation

If Supabase warns about bounced emails, do the following:

1. Validate email format before accepting pilot entry.
2. Block obvious typo domains (already implemented in app).
3. Avoid repeated tests to fake addresses.
4. If you re-enable magic links later, configure custom SMTP for production.

### What To Watch Out For

1. Open insert policy (`with check (true)`) is acceptable for pilot telemetry, but do not use this as-is for production without tighter controls.
2. Keep payloads small: store counts/status/category, not raw patient values.
3. Local queue is intentionally capped; very old events may be dropped if the queue exceeds the limit.
4. If Supabase is down, app still works and queues events locally until next successful flush.
5. Retention: periodically archive or delete old telemetry records.

### Optional: Central Email Attempt Logs (Supabase)

The app stores sign-in email attempts in local browser storage and queues failed sends for retry when internet returns. This is already covered by the SQL setup block above (`auth_email_log` table + policy).

### Emergency Reset Backdoor

If a user typed the wrong email and the device is sealed, tap the NursePath header logo 5 times to clear local pilot identity and reload.

### Formal Testing Requirement

For formal testing, participants must actively check the usage-tracking consent checkbox before they can tap Get Started.
